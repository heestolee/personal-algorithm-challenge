/**
 *Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

Example(Input --> Output)

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5"
Note: In COBOL, it should return "found the needle at position 6"
 */

export default function findNeedle(haystack) {
  let index = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < haystack.length; i++) {
    if (haystack[i] === "needle") {
      break;
    }
    if(index === haystack.length) {
      return `Your function didn't return anything`;
    }
    index++;
  }

  return `found the needle at position ${index}`
}
